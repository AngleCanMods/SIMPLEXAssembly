## Description

Simply, this adds the ability to manipulate all parts in Construction mode, if you have enough Kerbals to handle those part sizes.

There is an additional cfg that removes inventory from crewed parts. You may delete this second cfg.

THANKS TO @Gotmachine for getting the MM patching correct!

Recommend with: [**Exoskeleton mod**](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/index.php?/topic/200697-wip1111-khsk-kerbal-heavy-exoskeleton-kit/
).

Sandcastle integration configs to allow printing all stock parts that will fit within the custom provided printer parts. These of course can be manipulated by kerbals in construction mode.

Keridian Dynamics intergration for Sandcastle.

Extraplanetary Launchpads - Keridian Dynamics hides the EL parts as KD does a better job and looking awesome and stockalike.
