// 	Using LGG Part Volume mod, the packedVolume of a hitchhiker (crewCabin) is 14867 litres, close enough to 15000.
//	The hitchhiker is only just bigger than three cargoContainers (2.5m ones) stacked.  Kinda the same visually
//	These have 2500 liter cargo capacity each in stock, and so three should give 7500 litres, which is only half the bounding volume of the hitchhiker
//	That means half the volume is wasted capacity.
//	Looking at this logically, the walls, hinges, whatever of the cargoContainer sohould take space.  I'm suggesting that rather than double, the sapce is increased by 80% again.
//	That means four stacked, cargo Containers would have a littel extra space but theoretically could contain a hitchiker.
